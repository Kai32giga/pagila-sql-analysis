# üìä Pagila SQL Analysis Project

This project showcases SQL-based analysis performed on the **Pagila** movie rental database (a PostgreSQL adaptation of the Sakila sample DB).

It demonstrates real-world SQL skills such as multi-table joins, aggregation, filtering, subqueries, and time-based analysis. These are essential for data science, data analyst, and business intelligence roles.

---

## üîç Project Objective

To extract meaningful insights from a movie rental system using advanced SQL queries that answer key business questions, including:

- Which movies are most popular?
- Who are the top customers by revenue?
- What are the monthly revenue trends?
- Which store has the most rentals?
- Which films were never rented?

---

## üß∞ Tools Used

- **PostgreSQL** with **pgAdmin 4**
- Dataset: [Pagila Database](https://github.com/devrimgunduz/pagila)

---

## üìÅ Files Included

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `pagila-sql-analysis.sql` | Contains all SQL queries with comments |
| `README.md` | This documentation file |

---

## üß† Key SQL Concepts Used

- `JOIN` (INNER, LEFT)
- `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`
- `DATE_TRUNC()` for time grouping
- Subqueries
- Filtering with `NOT IN`
- Aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`

## ‚úÖ Sample Queries

```sql
-- Top 5 Revenue-Generating Customers
SELECT c.first_name || ' ' || c.last_name AS customer_name, SUM(p.amount) AS total_spent
FROM customer c
JOIN payment p ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
GROUP BY customer_name
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

```sql
-- Movies Never Rented
SELECT f.title
FROM film f
WHERE f.film_id NOT IN (
  SELECT i.film_id
  FROM inventory i
  JOIN rental r ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id
);
```

---

## üìå How to Run

1. Import `pagila.schema` and `pagila.data` into PostgreSQL using pgAdmin
2. Open Query Tool and run `pagila-sql-analysis.sql`
3. Review output and explore modifying queries

## üìà Potential Extensions

- Export results to CSV for visualization
- Integrate with a dashboard (Power BI / Tableau)
- Use Python + SQL (Jupyter Notebook) for report generation
